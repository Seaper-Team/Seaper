## Project Background

### Why set up this project

Actually **Seaper** is inspired by **Minecraft Server Manager (MCSM)** and **Pterodactyl (Pterodactyl)**, Seaper combines the **advantages and features** of both parties to create a **perfect web panel**.

### Origin of the name

**Seaper** is actually a combination of **Sea** and **Paper**, suggesting that the original intention was to allow our application to run on **any platform**, while also being **lightweight and practical**, like a piece of paper that won't break even at sea.

## Installation method

**Seaper** is an **open source project**, so there are two types of installation: **_packaged_installation, compiled_installation**.

### packaged_installation

The recommended way for **regular users**, you just need to **download** the **compressed package** we have prepared, **unzip and run** it.

1. Go to [Release](https://github.com/Xiaoyi311/Seaper/releases) in this repository and download the latest version of the zip file (not Source Code!)
2. Unzip the downloaded package, you need to open ``start.bat`` for Windows systems, and ``start.sh`` for Linux systems.

### compiled_installation

Recommend **developers** use a way, more trouble, need to **configure the development environment**.

Currently not available, the front-end is not built.
